Back to Color
=============

Introduction
------------

Hello!

This time I'm here to show you my first GBC demo! Specially made for the
[2014 GBDev Game Boy Coding Compo](http://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/viewtopic.php?id=173).

I started it like four years ago, but stopped after doing 3 scenes (the first
effect, the text scroller at the end of the first song and the colorful horizontal
bars before the matrix effect). I've coded the rest in just a few weeks, in fact
I started doing new effects a few days before the GBDev compo announcement. I've
coded it and made the music, the only thing I haven't done is the train screen
graphics and the credits graphics. I'm not a very good musician, so... Oh, and it
shows a little credits screen in non-color GBs!

If you want to test it in an emulator use one of:
- [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/)
- [Gambatte](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gambatte/)
- [VBA-M](http://vba-m.com/)
- My [GiiBii Advance](https://github.com/AntonioND/giibiiadvance) :P

Most emulators have a "Frame Blending" option, enable it to simulate the real
Game Boy LCD. It works in real hardware, of course! I've tested it in DMG, MGB,
GBC, GBA and GBA SP. Non-color GB only show the reduced credits screen!

If you want to skip some parts, hold up/right/down/left when the demo is loading.
- Up: Go to the effect before the blobs.
- Right: Go to the pentagon effect.
- Down: Go to the fire effect.
- Left: Credits.

The demo has been made using:
- [My fork of RGBDS](https://github.com/AntonioND/rgbds) (with a few bugfixes)
- A [GBT Player](https://github.com/AntonioND/gbt-player) version modified to use
  only the first ROM bank.
- OpenMPT to make the music.
- GBTK and GBMB.
- MSPaint :P
- A bit of Photoshop

I hope you like it! :)
